        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        

        <div class="quote-block">"I believe that I am first and foremost a human being, like you – or anyway, that I must try to become one." – Henrik Ibsen </div>

        
        <p>"A Doll's House" by Henrik Ibsen is a groundbreaking play that critiques societal norms and gender roles in the 19th century. The story revolves around Nora Helmer, a seemingly content housewife who is secretly hiding a past where she defied societal expectations to save her husband's life. As the play unfolds, Nora's husband, Torvald, treats her more like a child or a pet than an equal partner, reflecting the patriarchal society they live in. When a creditor threatens to expose Nora's forgery of a signature to secure a loan, she is forced to confront the reality of her position and the true nature of her relationship with Torvald. </p>

<p>The climax comes when Torvald's reaction to the crisis reveals his concern for his reputation over his wife, prompting Nora to question her entire life and the values she has held dear. In a dramatic finale, Nora decides to leave her husband and children, seeking self-discovery and independence. Ibsen's play challenges the audience to consider the rights and autonomy of women, the institution of marriage, and the impact of societal expectations on personal identity. I am going to share my discussion about what would happen after Nora left her husband and family later in this blog.

        <h2>Author – Henrik Ibsen</h2>
        <p>Henrik Ibsen (1828-1906) is widely recognized as a titan of modern drama and the "father of realism" in theater. Born in Skien, Norway, Ibsen's work is marked by its moral analysis set against a realistic middle-class backdrop, featuring penetrating dialogue and rigorous thought. His plays, such as "A Doll's House," "Ghosts," and "Hedda Gabler," broke with traditional conventions, exploring existential themes and societal critiques. Ibsen's complex characters and his unflinching examination of gender roles, human nature, and societal issues have left an indelible mark on literature and theater, influencing generations of playwrights and fueling ongoing discussions about the complexities of the human experience.

          <h2>Analysis - the Feasibility and Real Significance of Nora's Leave</h2>
    <p>Ibsen's A Doll's House is a quintessential social problem play that depicts the story of a housewife, trapped like a bird in a cage, awakening to her consciousness and resolutely leaving home, thereby raising the social issue of exploring the path to women's liberation. The final slamming door of the play resonates like thunder from Northern Europe to China, creating a series of "Nora-type" new Chinese female images. However, in his lecture "What Happens After Nora Leaves?", Lu Xun mentioned the limitations that Nora, as a woman of her time, faced in terms of economic foundations and the inevitability of her either falling into depravity or returning. Yet, if we return to the work and focus on the context of the times, Nora was not without options; instead, she could pave a wider path. </p><p>

Nora is a woman with an independent consciousness and a rebellious spirit. This independence and rebellion lay the foundation for her not returning home. Once the dream is over, it is difficult to go back, especially for an independent woman like Nora. Although she has always been treated by Helmer as a "bird in a cage," and has been compliant in every way, she still retains her stubbornness and resistance in all aspects of life. When she learns that her husband is ill and cannot raise enough funds, she does not accept the coercion and temptation of Krogstad to get simple help, but resolutely takes the responsibility and guilt of borrowing money under a false name to raise enough money for her husband. This shows Nora's deep-seated adherence to principles and is not a role that follows the orders of men. She has considerations for her husband's fate and for her own family, and these considerations and adherence can allow her to continue to insist on her departure, to find a career and direction suitable for herself. At the same time, when she is in danger and cannot turn danger into safety, she seeks help from Dr. Rank. However, before she can finish her request, Dr. Rank starts talking about his love for her, and Nora immediately gets up to end the conversation. Moreover, although she has been compliant in the family and has no freedom, she occasionally shows her own voice in the details, perhaps without receiving attention. Nora is very annoyed that her husband Helmer does not call her by her name but often calls her "little bird," "little squirrel," and so on, and she tells Helmer, "Go away, Torvald, I don't like to hear these words." However, Helmer does not show the attention she deserves, and she is very dissatisfied with Helmer's contempt for her and his chauvinism. She dares to challenge these traditional moral concepts of the secular world and gradually develops a strong pursuit of gender equality in the end of the work. She says, "Now I believe that first of all I am a person, the same person as you - at least I want to learn to be a person." This kind of thinking lays a good ideological foundation for Nora's new life after leaving home, adding opportunities to find opportunities and start a new life after leaving home. </p><p>

The social background and the rise of feminism at the time laid a good foundation for Nora's departure. Feminism provided a good social foundation for women to leave their families independently and made people care more about women's lives, based on their corresponding freedom to work and live. The character of Mrs. Lin Dan's self-reliance in the play proves the possibility of women living independently in that era, and in reality, Camille Claudel published "The Daughters of Clerks" in 1854-1855, which promoted the women's liberation movement, and feminist Ostanshte also launched a strong movement against men's infringement on women. At the same time, Norwegian scholar Dai Li pointed out in his works that women were allowed to participate in private liberal clubs. Women in that era were gradually given more and more free rights, and they began to have their own lives, such as attending parties. These social progress and openness also made it easier for Nora to start a new life and have the right to economic freedom. Of course, feminism has already existed in Norway and supports their continuous development, but difficulties still exist. As Lu Xun pointed out in "What Happens After Nora Leaves?", economic problems still exist, and for women who leave home and have no money, starting a new life from scratch is always difficult. However, based on the good social environment and her inner independent spirit, she has already had a new way of life. The necessary toughness to strive for economic freedom has also brought the most positive possibility for Nora to start a new life.</p><p>

At the same time, considering its impact on other countries, Nora's departure has the highest value in any case. This spirit will be applied to internal social changes, extending its influence not only to Norway but also to every corner of society, such as China. At that time in China, Nora's spirit reflected a kind of people, especially women's inner awakening and rebellious ideas. Hu Shi's "Ibsenization" and individualism also reflected the needs of Chinese society at that time to a certain extent. It is not only a change in external behavior but also a need for deep inner awakening. Lu Xun's "What Happens After Nora Leaves?" criticizes the results of Nora's departure from the outside, especially from the perspective of money, but if Nora had not become an independent woman and lacked inner awakening, even if she had endless wealth, she would still be a puppet and a doll, whether in the family or in society. At the same time, he mentioned that collective liberation is the premise of individual liberation, but without individual inner change and liberation, collective liberation will lack momentum and is difficult to achieve. Therefore, inner change and awakening can bring more long-term external changes, which determines that inner change must appear earlier than social change. Reflecting on China's revolutionary cause, the establishment and development of the Chinese Communist Party also took a similar path. From the uncertainty of just being established to unfair treatment, but the firm inner faith of the revolutionary pioneers has led to the successful realization of the Chinese people's democratic revolution. This is not just a coincidence, but the inevitable law of revolution. Of course, Nora's spiritual awakening and social change are only the beginning, and these difficulties still exist, but they will all become the premise of change, just like the difficult process of women in our society today to achieve equal status.</p><p>

Based on this, Nora's departure will not plunge her into the abyss, but will make the path of independence and autonomy wider and explore more possibilities. Good social conditions and a positive spirit make Nora's departure the right choice. However, the real situation is still unknown. Ibsen once said, "Asking questions is my business, but I don't have the answers." Uncertainty still exists, and we cannot get an accurate answer from the work itself. However, the "rebellious spirit" and the positive attitude towards life advocated in the work gradually recognize the reality in interpersonal interactions, showing an image of a woman who is gentle on the outside but strong on the inside, and has set a good example for more "Nora" from different countries and different societies, but facing the same problems. At the same time, this is not only a proposal for women's liberation, but also a story of the oppressed people who finally go to resist, and these "Nora", whether male or female, can all get the courage to resist injustice, smash the shackles on their bodies. Although the future is unpredictable, this will be a good start, and the road under the feet will be wider and wider.

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>"A Doll's House" stands as a seminal work that challenges the very fabric of societal norms and personal relationships. It encapsulates the essence of individualism and the quest for self-actualization against the backdrop of a patriarchal society. Ibsen's narrative not only exposes the superficiality of marital bonds but also underscores the importance of personal integrity and the courage to pursue one's own truth. Nora's departure is a resounding declaration of independence, a symbol of the human spirit's yearning for freedom and authenticity. The play remains a poignant reminder of the ongoing struggle for equality and the enduring power of the individual to redefine their own destiny.
