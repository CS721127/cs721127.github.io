        <h2>Preface - Written on Oct 17, 2025</h2>
        

        <div class="quote-block">"Develop into a lifelong self-learner through voracious reading; cultivate curiosity and strive to become a little wiser every day.”
― Charles T. Munger</div>

    <p>It feels almost unreal, reading these words again, the essay I wrote back in 2024, when I was preparing to send my dreams across the ocean to the United States. I remember the person I was then: full of plans, hopes, and that quiet fire of youth that believed the world was wide open. I was going to study finance and economics, to build something stable and certain.</p><p>
But life, as it always does, turned gently in another direction. I found myself in Australia, at UNSW, studying computer science–an entirely different landscape–yet somehow still a continuation of the same journey. A different path, yes, but walked by the same traveler.</p><p>
Looking back, I realize that the essence of who I am hasn’t changed. I am still Cen Sun: a young man who wants to understand people, to see the good in them, and to find meaning in small things. The same heart that once dreamed of Wall Street now dreams of building something that can touch both my life and others’ lives within this vast current of AI and technology.</p><div class="quote-block">“To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.” — Ralph Waldo Emerson</div>
<p>
Sometimes, being far from home brings moments of confusion and loneliness. Yet this essay, written by the version of me who hadn’t yet known those feelings, now stands as a quiet reminder—to stay gentle, to stay open, to stay curious. To keep believing that kindness is strength, and that sincerity is its own form of wisdom.
To my younger self, who wrote these words with unshaken optimism: thank you. You didn’t know it then, but your faith built a bridge for me to walk across.</p>
<div class="quote-block">"In every storm, the shelter of family love is our greatest refuge." — Unknown</div><p>
And to my present self, reading them now: don’t lose that spark. Keep reading, keep learning, keep growing. Keep believing that no dream is too distant, no change too great, and no detour without meaning. Even when the road twists and bends, remember—you are still you. And no matter where you go, your family will always be behind you, supporting you every step of the way.</p><p>
And that—always—will be enough.</p>

        
        



        <h2>Personal Statement - Find the Inner Treasure</h2>
        
        

        
        
    
        

          
    
        
    
        

        

        
        <p>My childhood room was filled with colorful paper crafts. “It was boring!” As their style was always the same, I yearned for something new. Striving to find the best decorations that could satisfy me, I was constantly making and repurposing. </p><p>
One day, when wrapping my tools in old newspapers, a picture of a harvest season with joy on farmers' faces attracted me—"That was my thing!” I started to create unique art from newspapers. Clips found in newspapers of financial buildings and sunsets added real-world tastes to my art, which now included wallets, animals, and more. </p><p>
As I grew older, I maintained the habit of collecting newspapers and magazines abandoned by others so that I could later repurpose them for my art, satisfying my creative needs for many years. However, I considered this only a unique serendipity until CS projects in high school made me realize why this early passion was indeed far more useful.</p><p>
Being assigned a project with the topic "anything learned" and "useful," my group reluctantly chose to make a Calendar as it could pretend useful. Functioning save, search, and output: That was our work needed to earn an A. I treated it conventionally at first, only looking to include enough functionality to ensure the grade. </p><p>
Coincidentally, I was simultaneously annoyed with the existing TOEFL-Vocabulary application I was using, which only allowed me to use the built-in lists without additions. An inspiration from the Calendar dawned on me—utilizing its code for basic functions— to create my word(s) of the day vocab-program. By changing the program’s structure slightly with a few extra functions, I obtained the best vocab-program ever. Long past what submitted for class, having created the best tool for studying TOEFL, I continued using the Calendar in all of my classes that need specific vocabulary (e.g. biology). Well, at least the vocabulary tool. </p><p>
While the Calendar itself may have lost its usefulness or never have been that functional to begin with, it showed me that in-class knowledge can be the place to start, but it is up to me to continue my learning to where my needs actually align. This is the lesson that I especially remembered when learning about the term “intrinsic value,” the MOST important measurement for value investing distinct from market prices, which differs for different investors. I began to reflect to figure out how I would define this within my own life. The answer I found was simple: Helping others! </p><p>
Having found my niche in the interest of investment, I co-founded BNDS Investment Club to help people who shared this passion. Recognizing my strengths in humanities, I became a TA, assisting students with difficulty in different classes. Also, leveraging my school connections and relationships with staff, I established Aspirational DreamWork to help students realize their ideas of exhibiting or diversifying themselves in school. Though wondering if actions like this were actually helping others, I fortunately found that we were all gaining many friendships and improving our skills. </p><p>
Now, I try to pay attention to all things around me, seeking to be the “right” person who is able to, whether for myself or others, discover features that are helpful and valuable. Eager to explore and utilize my potential in wider communities, I’ve gained a lifelong attitude: despite what “market value” dictates or others suggest, never self-deny or overlook any meaningless things. </p><p>
The lessons I hope you come to know me by go something like: We all can define “intrinsic value,” and just because something is useful to someone doesn’t mean it will be useful to everyone. Aspiring to not be affected by random judgements from others, I understand that higher “market value” may lead to loss, but higher “intrinsic value” will lead to gain. Just create yourself, and never be afraid to add an extra feature!
    </p><p>
I'm whom with these values, and I will thrive in my challenging, yet new college life!
</p>
<h2>Cornell - Community Essay</h2>
<p>
I belong to and have been shaped most by my high school student community. </p><p>Receiving much help from it, I have also chosen to be a sharer, a leader, and a student-rights advocate. </p><p>
I recognize that when I started high school without strong academic interests and coming from a school without many resources, it was older students that showed me the way to succeed at BNDS, a tradition I have continued to help new students find their own paths to success. From their help, I also want to use my ability to make others better. </p><p>
Consequently: </p><p>
I became a TA, using my knowledge to help new students and preparing review sessions facilitating their studies. Deeply aware of the help the former TA provided me when I first took AP Economics, I focused mostly on asking for, and changing my teaching based on student feedback and common mistakes I had made before. At the same time answering others' questions, I became also inspired by them such as questioning "Why exchange rates change?" rather than “When do they change?”.</p><p>
Starting an international charity help from my own capacity, I extended a project based on school teachers’ idea but beyond, helping poor students in Honduras since late 2022. As initiators, realizing the challenges for students to obtain glasses after talking with our Honduran teacher. We started on November 20, 2022, holding fun activities utilizing our specials to raise funds.</p><p> All together we have raised around 10,000 RMB and cooperating with local factories shipped more than 500 pairs of glasses. </p><p>
Also, within school, I became a student-right advocate. I started Aspirational Dreamwork, not only realizing their “dreams”, but bridging the feedback gap between students and our school. </p><p>Collecting students’ feedback on daily issues and address with the relevant school departments, we have resolved issues with Dining Hall services, addressed network connectivity, improved playground facilities, and assisted in starting clubs like the first Chinese High School Water Polo Club and Tibetan Culture Exhibition.</p><p>
Always being helpful and making people engaged is what community has shaped me. I am eager to keep this going in college!

</p>
      <h2>UC - Leadership</h2>
<p>
I lead holistically, determined to always help through my best efforts. I may be naturally shy, but I always make it my goal to project enthusiasm and support everyone who needs assistance. I may not be the headline-grabbing style that people usually think of, but leaders don’t always need to be loud to contribute.
</p><p>
Drawing on my experiences of the difficulties in organizing student club programs, I created the "Aspirational DreamWork" initiative, a resource for networking, that facilitates club funding and helps with problem-solving when students deal with the school administration. 
</p><p>
When I first came to my high school, I thoroughly enjoyed sharing my interests with others and wanted to start a business club, but the mass of school red tape involved meant it took a much longer time to achieve than I had hoped. One day, my friend approached me, expressing that he felt anxious because many students had found clubs that interested them, but he had not. He had the idea of starting his own club, but did not know how to proceed . Knowing that I had started one, he sought my help. Upon hearing this, I attempted to soothe his emotions and make him feel more comfortable. 
</p><p>
Drawing on my own experience, I reassured him that everything happens in its own time and that he did not have to worry. Once he had calmed down, I engaged in a deeper conversation with him and discovered that he wanted to organize a club that would combine his interest in mathematics with his passion for history. I introduced him to the math teacher who was responsible for clubs  and guided my friend through the process to achieve his goal. He shared his plans with me as he went, and I offered my feedback. Ultimately, the club was established and became a great success within the school community.
</p><p>
This experience also prompted me to reflect on the fact that many students may feel anxious and helpless when they first enter school and need guidance in balancing their time between activities and studies. As a result, I founded "Aspirational DreamWork" to help others and became the bridge between students and school in extension. Thus far, we have helped establish the first Chinese high school water-polo club, Tibetan culture exhibition, the first school maths festival, etc., and to be continued...

</p><h2>UC - Creativity</h2>
<p>
Never overly confident in creating from scratch, my creativity lies in identifying internal connections between different things to shape new perspectives or methods. A year ago, I took AP CSA class and started preparing for the TOEFL, two seemingly unrelated pursuits. </p><p>
The project for CSA with topic "anything learned" and "useful" made me reluctantly choose to make a Calendar, as it could at least appear to be a useful product even if I wasn’t sure how at first. Functioning input, save, search, and output is work to earn an A. Though after scoring, I kept my expectations for the Calendar, stored these basic codes waiting for potential future connections.</p><p>
Contemporaneously, my TOEFL Vocab application was increasingly annoying me, by forbidding additions to its built-in word lists. I needed the greater functionality, and had the inspiration to modify the basic codes for the existing Calendar program to fit any content or data I required, including supplementary language for TOEFL. By tweaking the app structure and adding extra functions, I created the best vocabulary program I have ever used. Long after the CSA submission, I kept using my amazing tool, further adapting it for use in every classes that need specific vocabulary (such as biology), supporting my belief my creative talents were best used to connect seemingly unrelated things. By semester’s end of semester, 14 other students in AP Biology were using my ‘calendar’ tool, and countless TOEFL students.</p><p>
I didn’t imagine or construct something 100% new - I don’t think my creativity is best used that way, but I did have the imagination to identify adaptable features in two existing programs and combine them into something new, practical and useful.</p><p>
This creation, which has continued to evolve into a flashcard software for reviewing learned definitions, and into a tool for note-taking to facilitate revision, has also reshaped my personal learning approach. My interdisciplinary thinking now focuses on the strengths and deficiencies with different academic fields, creating new connections between and perspectives within everything I study.
</p><h2>UC - Education</h2>
<p>
Attracted by the focus on resource allocation in economics, I began to explore. Starting without guidance, I randomly reading books like "Poor Economics" and "Behavioral Economics," while taking open courses online. Despite the foundational knowledge  I gained, I still lacked a clear understanding of how to focus my own interest—economic growth. </p><p>
The Pioneer Research program offered an undergraduate-level economic research opportunity. My mentor at Kenyon College professor Li’s specialization in econometrics and macroeconomics matched my interests perfectly, and enabled me to pursue a project I felt engaged with. Guided by my mentor, I started with the general field of "world economy", and wrote some naive questions relating to this topic. As I learned, I progressed to identifying some gaps in modern research and formulated more feasible research questions. I ultimately limited my scope to Australia, as a developed country with relatively stable growth despite recent financial crises.</p><p>
I learned for the first time how to break down dry formulas from textbooks into empirical factors and use STATA for data analysis. I learned how Total Factor Productivity, a variable that does not truly exist but determines the Solow Growth Model, is derived from continuous data estimation. Moreover, the emphasis on "comprehension" that my professor consistently highlighted during sessions stimulated my interest.</p><p> I realized that research is not simply analyzing or using models, but rather, is about asking “why?”; for example, why Australia’s TFP has been less affected by external factors. Using aspects from theories such as the Solow model, I was able to construct my paper.</p><p>
The Pioneer Research opportunity has shaped and refined my understanding of research, resulting in a focus on meaningful study questions while considering all stakeholders. I have since maintained my curiosity about economic growth, and selectively read related texts and explore concepts through empirical analysis. The research methods I learned have been additionally applicable to other fields of interest (such as politics and AI) such as through integration within the AP Seminar course. Currently, I am seeking further opportunities for further study of population growth and technological innovation under economic growth.
</p>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>
Time drifts quietly, carrying away the naive faces, cities, and dreams that once defined us. Yet somewhere beneath all the change, the same flame still flickers — gentle, stubborn, alive.</p><p>
The boy who wrote that essay still walks beside me. Sometimes he’s silent, sometimes smiling. I owe him that — the courage to keep believing, to keep feeling, even when the world feels too fast.</p><p>
Maybe growing up isn’t about becoming someone else, but about learning to carry that fire more tenderly — to protect it, to feed it, to let it light the dark corners when everything feels uncertain.</p><p>
So here’s to staying alive in every sense of the word — to thinking deeply, feeling freely, loving without calculation.
To standing in the wind with eyes bright and heart open..</p>

<div class="quote-block">"保持热烈，永远热泪盈眶。" <br>
Stay passionate. Stay moved.</div><p>
Let your heart keep trembling for the things that make life worth living.
