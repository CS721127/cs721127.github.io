        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>As part of my English Literature class, I recently had the pleasure of reading "The Tempest" by Shakespeare. This famous play, written in 1611, continues to captivate readers with its clever wordplay, social satire, and reflection on the world-wide problem that time.</p>

        <div class="quote-block">“O brave new world, That has such people in't!” – Miranda, The Tempest</div>

        <h2>Plot Overview</h2>
        <p>The play is centered around Prospero, the exiled Duke of Milan, who uses his magical powers to orchestrate a storm that shipwrecks his enemies on a remote island. With the help of his spirit servant Ariel, Prospero seeks to right the wrongs done to him by his brother Antonio and the King of Naples. As the play progresses, relationships are tested, and characters are forced to confront their past actions, leading to a complex exploration of power, forgiveness, and redemption. Through a series of dramatic events, Prospero ultimately achieves his goal, and the play concludes with a promise of a new beginning.</p>

        <h2>Themes</h2>
        
        <ul>
          <li>The idea of colonization and dispossession</li>
          <li>The Idea of "Self" and "Other"</li>
          <li>Speak eloquently to the late twentieth-century readers</li>
          <li>Compare and Contrast between the nobles and natives</li>
        <li>Mirror and parodies of other characters</li></ul>

        <h2>Who is Caliban?</h2>
        <p>The "Other." Prospero's reluctant slave, the offspring of the sorceress Sycorax, who once governed the island until her demise before Prospero's arrival. Caliban holds the belief that he is the rightful ruler of the land. Initially, Caliban extended a hand of friendship to Prospero, who in turn provided him with an education. However, Caliban soon realized that Prospero would never regard him as anything more than a civilized barbarian. Despite his capacity for emotional depth and eloquence, Caliban is filled with rage and resentment, and his sole desire is to be free from Prospero's control. The name Caliban is almost an anagram for "cannibal," and in many respects, he represents the indigenous peoples encountered by European colonizers. Through Caliban's relationship with Prospero, Shakespeare delves into the themes of colonialism and the dynamics between the colonizer and the colonized.
</p>
    <h2>Who is Prospero?</h2>
        <p>The "Self." He is the rightful Duke of Milan, yet was usurped by his brother Antonio and King Alonso of Naples, leading to his exile to a deserted island with his daughter Miranda. Over the course of 12 years, Prospero has transformed into a formidable enchanter, wielding control over the spirit Ariel and the native Caliban. His magical prowess grants him dominion over the island's inhabitants, allowing him to orchestrate events with precision. Critics often liken Prospero to a playwright, as he manipulates the lives of those around him much like an author controls characters in a narrative. Despite his domineering nature and expectations of loyalty, Prospero is not a vengeful character. In a pivotal act of forgiveness, he relinquishes his magic and opts for reconciliation with his adversaries, showcasing a complex character who evolves from a manipulator to a figure of mercy and redemption.

</p>

          <h2>Analysis - "Self" and "Other" Under Caliban's Character</h2>
    <p>The character of Caliban reflects Shakespeare’s idea of colonizing and colonized. When Shakespeare wrote his play in 1611, the world was centered on Europe and started expanding from there to the other side of the world. While Spain had already been the overlord of the world and England was building its empire, Shakespeare was aware of this expansion and started including this notion in his writings, specifically in terms of “self” and “others.” When Prospero “takest [the island] from [Caliban],” he treats Caliban as a “subject” he owns, enslaving him without any freedoms. It is not only his subjugating of “Caliban’s” island but also deeming Caliban as “others” and him as a “self.” This difference stemmed from their different power, the magic, just like the colonizers from Europe have the power of using guns, epitomizing the long-lasting relationship between “settlers” and “Indians.” Moreover, Caliban, the only native on the island, did not perceive anything bad about Prospero the first time they met. At first, Caliban shared with him “all the qualities of the island,” and Prospero treated Caliban just like a normal human being, indicating the kind origin of colonizing. It was when Prospero understood Caliban’s weaknesses and desired more resources on the island he caught Caliban as his slave, well reflecting the idea of colonization when the settlers finally realized their power of fireworks and the value of the new continent. Thus, colonized areas eventually served as “others” to be exploited by the “self,” which was exemplified by Caliban’s relationship with Prospero. </p>  <p>
The character of Caliban demonstrates the humanity behind his ugly appearance. The common agreement at the time that the “self” always represents civilized while “other” is savage has become obscured with the humanity that Caliban exhibits, challenging this popular certainty about self and others as he doesn’t fit any of the categories to be the “other.” He learned how to curse from Prospero. While it is true that Caliban is a native and hasn’t been educated before Prospero comes, he certainly has a capacity for civilization learned from the colonizer – the complexity of his language. At the time when the “self” views the “other” as savage and cannot be educated, Caliban’s curse overthrows that well-accepted claim, encouraging the public to reconsider the position that they should hold when dealing with “others.” This inspiration on people’s belief leaves an uncertainty to view the “self” and “other” not as good or bad but as something combined. Moreover, Caliban talks about his “dream” of the island with Sebastian, further challenging the idea that the “native” of the island is not human. His perfect exemplification of his humanity by expressing his dream with a complex language verifies that he is not the one people used to conceive – a monster and uncivilized savage, despite his identity as a native without formal education as Prospero did. The margin of self and others is becoming ambiguous, and his challenge to the existing injustice makes people question the world as “Europe-centered” and reevaluate the meaning of “others” with the ways to treat them. Despite the power of weapons they have, there seems not much difference between the two. Also, Caliban’s forgiveness to Prospero when he gives up all his magics further shows his humanity, making the world be clearer between “self” and “others.” </p> <p>
Caliban parodies other characters, mirroring from “others” to the “self.” Caliban’s island had been taken by Prospero while his dukedom had been taken by Antonio, indicating the commonality between “self” and “others,” that “self” is not a privilege to “others” yet “others” is not inferior to the “self.” Furthermore, when Ariel is a flying spirit on the island serving for Prospero, the “self,” Caliban, the “other,” can only move on the ground, showing the differences between “others,” admitting the contrast of power. When Ferdinand “bearing a log” for Prospero, Caliban appears “burden[ing] a wood,” further demonstrating that the “self” is not privileged than the “others,” as they all can be “slaved” by other “self.” This also shows a mobility between the pre-existing class of “self” and “others” that the two can be transferred to show the commonalities. The sequence of compare and contrast between Caliban and other characters obscure the differences, strengthening mobility and normality between “self” and “others.”

</p>
        
    <h2>Modern Relevance</h2>
        <p>"The Tempest" remains a powerful commentary on modern issues like mobility and colonialism's legacy. Caliban's plight mirrors indigenous struggles worldwide, highlighting cultural identity complexities. The play also addresses environmental stewardship, a pressing concern in our era of ecological crises. Shakespeare's exploration of these themes ensures "The Tempest" remains relevant, sparking discussions about control, reconciliation, and our responsibility to nature.

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>"The Tempest" reflects on multiple sides of the issues that Shakespeare was trying to address, including colonization, rebellion, and mobility, which are all great topics to notice while reading it. However, due to the space limit, this blog only covers Caliban as main focus. Really recommend interpreting this play from other perspectives!</p>
